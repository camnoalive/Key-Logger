# Key-Logger
Hello everyone!!! I'm back to "programming". I'm still learning and through the process I love making tiny projects like this.

Using previous code I had already used in another project, I created a klogger that sends the key logs inside a Discord channel.
To do this you'll need the channel ID and your auth token. To find those there are several videos and info on line how to.

# Running the Code

To get started open the python script and set your token and channel id and place. You will also need to install the required modules: requests, keyboard
To do that run the following commands in your terminal:
1. `pip install requests`
2. `pip install keyboard`
3. Once these are installed, run the python script as so: `python3 main.py`
4. Open your discord channel and have fun!!!

# !!Dislaimers!!
1. Using kloggers is bad. Dont be bad.
2. Using this key logger can be very dangerous for yourself as it exposes your discord auth token.
If you want to make the python file an EXE and hide your token from normal people you can. Although if person = smart, they can find your token.
3. This is just a tom foolery project, not meant to be a serious klogger. I would neverrr code something so evil.
4. I do believe using your discord auth token violates their TOS, use at your own risk.
!!Dislaimer End!!
